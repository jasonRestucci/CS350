<ins> Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. </ins>  <br><br><be>

The thermostat project involved creating a task scheduler that would use the temperature sensor on the CC3220x LAUCHXL to check the ambient temperature and turn the heat on or off. This would be represented by LEDs to show if the heat was on or off. Additionally, there are two buttons on the sides of the device that could be used to adjust the temperature set point. This is the point at which the thermostat would switch the heat. 


<ins> What did you do particularly well? </ins>  <br><br><be>

I think I organized, commented, and documented my code particularly well. I believe this has made my code much more readable, and easy to jump into.


<ins> Where could you improve? </ins>  <br><br><be>

I could have planned development a little better. In the future, I will separate the project into smaller tasks and dictate and manage my time more efficiently.


<ins> What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network? </ins>  <br><br><be>

Code Composer Studio is definitely the largest and most powerful thing I will be adding to my support network. I could not see developing embedded systems without it. The supporting materials found in this course are also great reference material.


<ins> What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework? </ins>  <br><br><be>

The experience I gained working with unfamiliar systems will be invaluable in other projects/coursework.


<ins> How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable? </ins>  <br><br><be>

Organizing my code with descriptive names and comments ensured the code could easily be understood and worked on in the future. Proper utilization of white space also helps with readability. Furthermore, my use of methods/functions also made my code more adaptable by making the more more modular.
